Make sure you install `yml` on your terminal so you can stitch the exercise files! Following the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14261614/how-do-i-install-the-yaml-package-for-python) worked for me. 

Once you have that installed, you can get started:

1. Clone the `Codecademy-content` repo and navigate to the folder belonging to the lesson you wish to stitch!
2. Download and place the `lesson_stitch.py` file inside that very directory, navigate to that place in your terminal and run the file. Here's an example of my directory for the vue instances lesson:
```/Users/nataliarodriguez/Codecademy/Codecademy-content/new/content/courses/en/vue-instances/units/vue-instances/lessons/vue-instances```

3. Inside the `lesson_stitch.py` edit the `lesson_yaml` variable to reflect the lesson's file name! 
4. Run the `lesson_stitch.py`file
5. The stitched lesson should be inside `stitched_exercises.txt` in that very folder! Enjoy:)
